# Next.js 13 vs Remix: An In-depth case study

This is the monorepo for the case study for comparing Next.js 13 and Remix, by building a Twitter Clone in both the frameworks. You can read about it in my latest blog: [Next.js 13 vs Remix: An In-depth case study](https://prateeksurna.me/blog/nextjs-13-vs-remix-an-in-depth-case-study).

Both the Next.js and Remix apps are deployed on Vercel. You can find the [Next.js app here](https://twitter-rsc.vercel.app) and the [Remix app here](https://twitter-remix-run.vercel.app/).
